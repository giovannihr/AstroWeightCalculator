# AstroWeightCalculator
Origin bootcamp project using javascript obejct literals and functional programming

Made a simple calculator to calculate what your weight would be in different planets.

You type in your weight(a number) and select a planet option and it will do the math for you and give you your new updated weight.

Behind the scenes:
Both the planet options and the text message was populated dynamically using pure javascript with no libraries;
it utilize multiple function and the document object methods to read input values, create new elements, do some calculations, and
store the results on those elements.
